# BreastCancer_detection_via_CNN
This project is based on the research article Breast Cancer Identification via Thermography Image Segmentation with a Gradient Vector Flow and a Convolutional Neural Network. I have managed to successfully train the CNN module, which will classify the thermography images as Brest cancer positive or negative.
